#Tidy dataset- Codebook for getting and cleaning data
This code book describes the variables, the data, and other transformations and work performed by run_analysis.R to clean up the data.
#Transformation Instructions
There are five parts:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
#Transformation Steps
* Requires plyr library
* Loads both x, y, and subject test and train and merges them 
* Labels the merged set using feature labels
* Extracts the mean and standard deviation values
* Adds activity labels to the extracted dataset
* Refines the variable names of the extracted dataset
* Creates a tidy data set based on the given filename
DataSet Variables Information
The tidy dataset contains observations with 81 variables:
1. ActivityName: Activity being performed
